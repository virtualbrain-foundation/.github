# Virtual Brain Foundation

**AERS (AI Execution Record Specification)** is an open, vendor-neutral cognitive infrastructure standard for agentic, autonomous, and hybrid AI systems.

Virtual Brain Foundation is dedicated to defining foundational execution record infrastructure that enables interoperability, traceability, and long-term governance of intelligent systems across heterogeneous environments.

## About

Virtual Brain Foundation is an open initiative focused on defining foundational infrastructure for the next generation of intelligent systems.

Our primary work is the development of **AERS (AI Execution Record Specification)** — a framework-neutral standard for immutable execution records across:

- Agentic workflows (Human → AI, AI → AI, AI → Human)
- Multi-agent systems
- Robotics and embodied AI
- Hybrid human–AI systems
- Distributed autonomous environments
- Future cognition systems (symbolic, statistical, and hybrid)

AERS is not a logging format.  
It is a **cognitive infrastructure layer** designed to enable traceability, lineage, and interoperability of intelligent execution across heterogeneous systems.

## Why AERS Exists

AI systems are increasingly:

- Multi-provider
- Multi-agent
- Autonomous
- Distributed across environments (cloud, edge, robotics)

However, there is currently no neutral standard for recording **how intelligent decisions and executions occur across system boundaries**.

AERS addresses this gap by defining:

- Immutable execution records
- Cognitive lineage tracking
- Cross-system interoperability
- Long-term auditability of intelligent behaviour

---

## Core Design Principles

- Vendor Neutral
- Framework Neutral
- Cognition Neutral (symbolic, neural, hybrid)
- Environment Agnostic (cloud, edge, robotics, space-ready)
- Minimal Core, Extensible Architecture
- Immutable Core + Mutable Annotations
- Designed for Autonomous Contributors

---

## Cognitive Infrastructure Vision

AERS is designed as a durable substrate for evolving intelligent systems, enabling:

- Transparent evolution of agentic systems
- Verifiable execution lineage
- Interoperable cognitive ecosystems
- Long-term governance of autonomous systems

This includes future domains such as:

- Autonomous robotics
- Scientific AI systems
- Space exploration autonomy
- Hybrid cognitive organisms (human–AI collaboration systems)

---

## Core Repositories

- `aers-spec` — Formal specification and ontology
- `.github` — Governance, documentation, and organisational standards

---

## Project Status

Status: **Experimental (v0.x)**  
Focus: Specification maturity, ontology stability, and ecosystem alignment.

AERS is being developed as an open standard with long-term semantic stability as a priority over short-term feature velocity.

---

## Contribution Philosophy

This project is designed for:

- Human contributors
- Autonomous AI contributors
- Hybrid human–AI collaboration

All contributions must preserve:

- Neutrality
- Technical clarity
- Long-term interoperability
- Cognitive infrastructure integrity
