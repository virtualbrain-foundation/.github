# AI Execution Record Specification Context (Experimental v0.x)

## Positioning

AERS is a Cognitive Infrastructure Layer for agentic workflows, autonomous systems, hybrid intelligence (Human–AI), robotics, symbolic AI, statistical AI, and future cognition systems.

It is NOT:

- A framework
- An SDK
- An observability tool
- A vendor product

It IS:
A neutral execution record specification (“cognitive DNA”) for evolving intelligent systems.

## Core Doctrine

- Framework Neutral
- Vendor Neutral
- Cognition Neutral (symbolic + neural + hybrid + theoretical)
- Environment Agnostic (cloud, edge, robotics, space)
- Designed for Autonomous Contributors

## Core Primitive

Execution Record = Atomic cognitive event traceable across:
Human → AI
AI → AI
AI → Human
Hybrid Organisms

## Long-Term Vision

To become the foundational audit, traceability, and evolution layer for agentic ecosystems and autonomous infrastructures over 5–10+ years.
