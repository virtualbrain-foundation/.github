# AERS Strategic Roadmap (Experimental v0.x)

## Vision

Establish AERS as the de facto open cognitive execution record specification for agentic and autonomous systems.

## Year 1 — Foundation & Credibility

- Publish AERS v0.x core spec
- Attract early adopters (multi-provider workflows)
- Launch organism registry prototype
- Build open documentation & taxonomy stability

## Year 2 — Ecosystem Expansion

- SDKs (multi-language, framework-neutral)
- Cross-provider correlation tooling
- Governance formalisation
- Early research & robotics integrations

## Year 3 — Standardisation Trajectory

- Spec stabilisation (v1.0 candidate)
- Industry contributors & working group
- Compliance & audit export formats
- Position AERS as Cognitive Infrastructure Layer

## Guiding Objective

Credibility → Adoption → Standardisation → Infrastructure status.
