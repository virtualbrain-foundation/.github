# AERS Taxonomy (Dual-Layer)

Status: Experimental v0.x

## Principle

Dual-layer naming:

1. Formal Neutral Term (infrastructure precision)
2. Biological Metaphor (cognitive intuition)

## Core Canonical Terms

| Formal Term      | Metaphor    | Definition                    |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Execution Record | Cell        | Atomic cognitive event        |
| Agentic System   | Organism    | Coordinated cognitive entity  |
| Causal Chain     | Lineage     | Traceable execution sequence  |
| Actor            | Entity      | Human, AI, Hybrid, Autonomous |
| Context Envelope | Environment | Surrounding execution state   |

## Stability Rules

- Never rename core primitives casually
- Maintain backward semantic traceability
- Prefer minimal vocabulary expansion
- Avoid vendor or framework terminology

## Neutrality Requirement

Terminology MUST remain:

- Framework-neutral
- AI-type neutral
- Future compatible (robotics, symbolic AI, quantum-assisted cognition)
