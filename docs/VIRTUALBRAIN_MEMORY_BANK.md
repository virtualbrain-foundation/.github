# Strategic Memory (Experimental v0.x)

## Project Identity

VirtualBrain Foundation develops AERS as an open, vendor-neutral cognitive infrastructure standard.

## Strategic Direction

- Influence-first (credibility before monetisation)
- Open standard core
- Optional commercial infrastructure layer (registry, analytics, compliance)

## Architectural North Star

“Git for AI Decisions”:

- Content-addressed
- Immutable core
- Extensible annotations
- Cross-provider correlation

## Core Repositories Roles

- aers-spec: Canonical protocol
- aers-registry: Execution organism registry (service layer)
- aers-sdk: Neutral tooling adapters
- governance: Strategic & institutional layer

## Design Philosophy

Start chatbot-grade → evolve to robotics-grade → autonomous organism infrastructure.
