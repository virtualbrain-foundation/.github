# Organisation Governance & Documentation Hub

This repository contains the organisational standards, governance documents, and AI-native guidance for the Virtual Brain Foundation ecosystem.

It serves as the coordination layer for all repositories related to:

- AERS (AI Execution Record Specification)
- Cognitive Infrastructure tooling
- Registry and ecosystem components
- Autonomous and human contributor alignment

---

# Purpose of This Repository

The `.github` repository defines the shared foundation for:

- Governance principles
- Naming conventions and taxonomy
- AI contributor instructions (Copilot / Codex / autonomous agents)
- Strategic roadmap and long-term direction
- Memory bank and contextual continuity

This ensures consistency across all ecosystem repositories.

# Relationship to Core Repositories

This repository does **not** contain the specification itself.

Core technical work lives in:

- `aers-spec` — Formal protocol and ontology

The `.github` repository provides organisational alignment and cognitive continuity across the ecosystem.

---

# AI-Native Development Philosophy

This organisation is structured to support:

- Autonomous contributors
- AI-assisted development workflows
- Long-horizon protocol design
- Cognition-native documentation practices

Instruction files such as:

- `copilot-instructions.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `AI_CONTEXT.md`

exist to ensure consistent behaviour from both human and AI contributors.
