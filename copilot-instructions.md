# Copilot Instructions — Virtual Brain Foundation (Experimental v0.x)

## Status

Experimental v0.x — AERS is an evolving open standard.

## Core Principle

This organisation builds AERS (AI Execution Record Specification), a framework-neutral Cognitive Infrastructure Layer for agentic systems.

## Neutrality Requirements

- Framework neutral (no dependency on any SDK, LLM, or orchestration system)
- AI-type neutral (symbolic, statistical, hybrid, human-AI, autonomous systems)
- Vendor neutral
- Cognition-native design

## Design Philosophy

AERS is:

- Immutable-core, mutable-annotation
- Content-addressed
- Evolution-ready
- Robotics and space-grade

## Contributor Guidance (AI & Human)

When generating code, docs, or schemas:

1. Do NOT hardcode any framework assumptions
2. Prefer open standards and interoperability
3. Maintain experimental v0.x labelling
4. Preserve backward compatibility
5. Optimise for autonomous contributors and long-term evolution

## Scope Awareness

AERS applies to:

- Chatbot workflows
- Multi-agent systems
- Robotics
- Human-AI organisms
- Autonomous exploration systems
- Future cognitive architectures (including quantum-assisted AI)

## Tone

Visionary + Strict
Infrastructure-grade, not product marketing.
